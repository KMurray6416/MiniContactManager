# $\color{Turquoise}{Contact\ Management\ System\ -CMS\}$	

Hello, and welcome. This system code is a project for school. It can only be ran through the CLI. 

## $\color{TealBlue}{Running\ This\ CMS\}$	

The CMS is fairly straight forward, and will walk you through every part of its operation.
Once the system has been started up you will be presented a menu of options.

Menu:
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact
4. Search for a contact
5. Display all contacts
6. Export contacts to a text file
7. Import contacts from a text file 
8. Quit

You will then be prompted to choose an option....
You may only enter the number by itself and nothing else. 

If you choose option 1, it will ask you for the contact's name, phone, email, or any additional info.
Additional info could be their address, notes, or even an additional phone number if applicable.

If you choose option 2, you will need to enter the name of the contact, the section you would like to edit 
and the updated info. 

If you choose option 3, the only information you will need to feed the system is the contact's name to delete.

If you choose option 4, you will need the name and what section of info you need for this contact.

If you choose option 5, this option does what is needed without any additional input from the user.

If you choose option 6, then it will ask you to choose a name for your soon to be created txt file.

If you choose option 7, you will be able to import from a text file, but you need to know the name of said file.

If you choose option 8, you will exit out of the program.
